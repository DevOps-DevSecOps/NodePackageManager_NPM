● package.json
The package.json file is the heart of Node.js system.
The package.json file helps us keep track of all the installed packages in a given project.
It is the manifest file of any Node.js project and contains the metadata of the project.
When creating a new project, it is important to start by creating this file.
It stores information about a project like the name of the project, its version, scripts, dependencies, and more.
When we install packages, a node_modules folder is created where can see other folders — namely, each package’s folder and subfolders.
In package.json file, packages are listed under dependencies because project is “depending” on those packages to get work done.
